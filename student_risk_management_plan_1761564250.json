        "final_plan": "Here's a summary of the risk management plan for Student 200000:**Risks:**Student 200000, an Arts student, currently faces a significant predicted risk of dropout (11%) despite not having dropped out yet. This high-risk profile is primarily driven by a low CGPA (5.5), a concerning attendance rate (64%), and a history of four past academic failures, indicating a need for urgent support.**Interventions:**Over the next five months, a comprehensive and empathetic support plan will be implemented. This includes:*   **Academic Support:** Immediate and targeted tutoring and assistance with assignments to improve understanding and academic performance.*   **Personal Development:** Regular mentorship (peer or faculty) and counseling sessions to address personal and academic challenges.*   **Integration & Well-being:** Participation in cultural integration activities and workshops to foster a sense of belonging and support.*   **Practical Assistance:** Guidance and support for applying for financial aid to alleviate potential financial stressors.*   **Regular Check-ins:** Weekly check-ins will be conducted to monitor progress and provide ongoing encouragement.**Timeline:**This intensive support plan spans five months (approximately 20 weeks), from Month 1 through Month 5, focusing on immediate and sustained intervention to address the identified risks.**Expected Outcomes:**The primary goal is to significantly reduce the student's dropout probability. We anticipate a notable improvement in academic performance (CGPA and attendance), enhanced personal well-being, and a stronger sense of integration within the university community, ultimately fostering a successful and supported academic journey."
