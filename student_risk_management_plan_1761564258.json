        "final_plan": "Here is a summary of the risk management plan for Student 200000:**Risks**Despite a low predicted dropout risk (0.11), Student 200000 faces significant academic and engagement challenges. Key concerns include a relatively low CGPA (5.50), a high number of past failures (4.0), and a low attendance rate (64.26%). These factors indicate potential difficulties in maintaining consistent academic performance, active participation, and overall academic progression.**Interventions**For the next five months, a multi-faceted and multi-pronged intervention plan will be implemented as part of a phased \"Academic-Engagement Program.\" This will likely include targeted academic support (e.g., tutoring, study skills workshops), strategies to improve attendance and active engagement (e.g., mentorship, encouraging participation in campus activities), and resources to address any underlying issues contributing to academic struggles.**Timeline**The comprehensive risk management plan will be actively implemented and monitored over the next five months.**Expected Outcomes**The primary goal is to significantly improve academic performance, increase attendance, and enhance overall student engagement. This program aims to boost the student's CGPA, reduce future failures, foster consistent participation, and ensure a more positive and successful academic journey, thereby mitigating the identified risks and supporting their long-term success."
